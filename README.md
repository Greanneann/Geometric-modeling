# Geometric Modeling Course

This repository contains coursework for a **Geometric Modeling** class. The work includes several laboratory assignments exploring key topics of the course.

## Labs Overview

### Lab 1: Lagrange and Hermite Interpolation, Runge Phenomenon
- **Topics:**
  - Lagrange interpolation for constructing polynomials through given data points.
  - Hermite interpolation, including derivatives at specific points.
  - Runge Phenomenon: Exploring oscillatory behavior in high-degree polynomial interpolation.

### Lab 2: Curvature Functions and Evolutes of Curves in 3D
- **Topics:**
  - Computing curvature functions for parameterized curves in 3D space.
  - Finding the evolute, the locus of centers of curvature for a curve.

### Lab 3: Surfaces and Differential Geometry
- **Topics:**
  - Surface geometry with first and second fundamental forms.
  - Analysis of principal directions, principal curvatures, mean curvature, and Gaussian curvature.
